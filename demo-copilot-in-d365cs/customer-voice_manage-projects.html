    <p>You can create a copy of your project in the same environment or a different environment. Dynamics 365 Customer

    <p><strong>What's copied to the new project?</strong></p>
    <ul>

        project.</li>
      <li><strong>Satisfaction metrics</strong>: All satisfaction metrics that were configured for their respective
        questions are copied to the new project. The satisfaction metrics retain their mappings with the questions in
        the newly created surveys.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Automate flows</strong>: All the Power Automate flows configured for the project are copied to
        the new project.</li>

        aria-label="Section titled: Share a project"></a>
      <h2 id="share-a-project" class="heading-anchor">Share a project</h2>
    </div>
    <p>You can share your project with multiple people in your organization so they can collaborate on the structure and
      layout of surveys within the project. The people with whom the project is shared become the co-owners of the
      shared project. The projects that are shared with you are available on the <strong>All projects</strong> tab.</p>
    <p>When you share a project, a <a
        href="/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal"
        data-linktype="absolute-path">Microsoft 365 group</a> is created in Azure Active Directory and the project
      co-owners are added as members of the group. When you remove a co-owner from the project, the co-owner is removed
      from the Azure Active Directory group. When you remove all co-owners from the project, the group is retained with
      you as its only member. When a Microsoft 365 group is created, a Microsoft Dataverse team (of type <a
        href="/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-teams#about-group-teams" data-linktype="absolute-path">Azure Active
        Directory group</a>) is created. The Dataverse team is assigned the ownership of the project and survey data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What can a co-owner do?</strong></p>
    <p>A project co-owner has the same level of permissions as the project owner. This means a co-owner can create,
      edit, update, delete, and share the project.</p>
    <p><strong>What can't a co-owner do?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A co-owner cannot remove the project creator from a shared project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A co-owner can't delete a survey that was created by another user. The survey can be deleted only by the user
          who created it. If a co-owner tries to delete a project that contains a survey created by another user, an
          error is displayed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A co-owner can't move a survey that was created by another user. The survey can be moved only by the user who
          created it. If a co-owner tries to move a survey that is created by another user, an error is displayed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How are the responses shared?</strong></p>
    <p>If a project contains responses, a co-owner can see all responses under <strong>Reports</strong> in the left
      pane. In the Customer Voice survey responses entity, only those responses that are received after the project was
      shared will be shared with co-owners. Projects and surveys are owned by the Microsoft Dataverse team (of type <a
        href="/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-teams#about-group-teams" data-linktype="absolute-path">Azure Active
        Directory group</a>). Only those responses that are received after the project is shared will be owned by the
      Dataverse team. Old responses will continue to be owned by the project owner.</p>

    </div>
    <p>You can update your project with the copy of the same project. The copy can reside in the same environment or a
      different one. By updating a copy of the project, you can make incremental changes while its survey is being sent
      to respondents and receiving responses, without interrupting the survey.</p>
    <div class="alert is-info">
      <p class="alert-title"><span class="docon docon-status-error-outline" aria-hidden="true"></span> Note</p>
      <p>A project can be updated only from a copy of itself, and not from any other project.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following components can be updated:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Satisfaction metrics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Survey
        <ul>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Description</li>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Questions and their corresponding answer options</li>
          <li>Survey customizations</li>
          <li>Survey distribution settings</li>
          <li>Email templates and their corresponding languages</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's understand the update operation with the following example.</p>
    <p>You work in a company named Contoso, and create and finalize surveys across the following environments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Development</strong>: The environment where you create and test surveys.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Production</strong>: The environment for live surveys, where you move finalized surveys and then
          share them with respondents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You've moved a customer satisfaction survey to the production environment, and want to make the following changes
      to it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a question</li>
      <li>Change the color theme</li>
      <li>Add a background image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a company policy, you can't edit surveys directly in the production environment. Therefore, you create a copy
      of the survey in the development environment and make the required changes. You now update the survey in the
      production environment by using the copy that you created and updated in the development environment.</p>
    <div class="alert is-info">
      <p class="alert-title"><span class="docon docon-status-error-outline" aria-hidden="true"></span> Note</p>
      <p>If a survey is available only in the target environment, but not in the source environment, the survey in the
        target environment will be deleted when you perform the update action on the target project. For example, if the
        source project has two surveys (S1 and S2) and the target project has three surveys (S1, S2, and S3), S3 will be
        deleted when you update the target project with the source project.</p>
